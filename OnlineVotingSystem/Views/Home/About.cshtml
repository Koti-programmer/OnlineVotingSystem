        The <strong>Online Voting System</strong> is a secure, user-friendly web application built using <strong>ASP.NET MVC (.NET Framework)</strong>. It allows registered users to log in and cast their votes for candidates of their choice in a simplified digital format.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application is designed to simulate a real-world electronic voting process. It provides modules for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>User Registration and Login</li>
        <li>Candidate Management</li>
        <li>Vote Casting</li>
        <li>Viewing Election Results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This system ensures one vote per user and maintains vote counts using a centralized database (SQL Server). The project demonstrates practical implementation of MVC architecture, Entity Framework, and LINQ in building real-world web applications.
